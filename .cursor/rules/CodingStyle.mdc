# Coding Style Guidelines

## TypeScript
- Always use TypeScript for new files
- Use explicit type annotations for function parameters and return types
- Use interfaces for objects that will be extended, types for simple definitions
- Avoid `any` type, prefer `unknown` when type is uncertain
- Use type guards to narrow down types when necessary

## React Patterns
- Use functional components with hooks
- Use named exports for components
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Extract complex logic to custom hooks
- Use the React Context API for state that needs to be accessed by many components

## State Management
- Use React's `useState` for simple local state
- Use React's `useReducer` for more complex state logic
- Store user authentication state in Auth Provider
- For shared state, consider using React Context API

## CSS/Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Follow mobile-first approach for responsive design
- Use semantic color names in class naming
- Group related styles together

## Error Handling
- Use try-catch blocks for async operations
- Display user-friendly error messages
- Log detailed error information for debugging
- Handle edge cases explicitly

## Testing
- Write unit tests for utility functions
- Write component tests for complex components
- Use Jest for testing
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

## Performance
- Use React.memo for preventing unnecessary re-renders
- Memoize expensive calculations with useMemo
- Memoize callbacks with useCallback when passed to child components
- Virtualize long lists with react-window or similar libraries

## Accessibility
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Include proper ARIA attributes
- Ensure keyboard navigation works properly
- Maintain sufficient color contrast

## Commenting
- Add comments for complex logic
- Document functions with JSDoc
- Keep comments updated with code changes
- Avoid commenting obvious code
